## Overview

This project aims to showcase the diverse applications of GANs in a user-friendly interface. The following applications are covered:
- Image Generation
- Medical Imaging
- Video Prediction
- Style Transfer
- Data Augmentation
- Anomaly Detection

Each application is represented with an interactive card and a "Learn More" button that navigates to a detailed page about the specific application.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Next-generation, fast build tool for React.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for custom designs.
- **React Router**: Declarative routing for React applications.
